                <h3>Here's some of the things we've worked on:</h3>
                <p>
                    Here's some of the things we've worked on:
                    - Identifying Waste: developed a way to eliminate all waste from processing oats into ice cream. We
                    make our oat cream from scratch with a process that doesn't require "extraction". Often when oat
                    milks use extraction, they remove part of the fibre that doesn't blend perfectly, this results in
                    leftover waste. We have a special process that allows us to keep all the fibre in the oat cream and
                    keeps everything ultra creamy.

                    - In House Production: build our own ice cream kitchen and facility and stop relying on co-packers.
                    We built our own facility to better control the quality and production of our ice creams. Did you
                    know that most ice cream brands, even some artisanal brands don't make their own ice cream? The
                    process is called co-packing and most experts will tell you this is the best route for producing and
                    they are correct in many ways. We tried this and found it to be very challenging to control quality,
                    even when it was our recipe in action. We decided to build our own production where we make
                    everything in house and control all the steps involved. We make our mixes from scratch in house, we
                    churn the ice cream in house, we bake all pastry and mix ins. It's more work this way but it tastes
                    better in our opinion.

                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our dad was starting an ice cream company.

                        What began as a barely whispered idea was soon actually happening. Though it came completely out
                        of the blue, we could make sense of it. He’d often talked of making something with his own two
                        hands, selling a real product to real people, and he’s always loved great ice cream.

                        He started small and set to work in our old barn at home in India. Our mum joined him and he
                        decided to name the company. On 19th December 2002 he walked across the field to the
                        village pub and sold the very first tub of Rainbow Cone's icecream.

                        We soon realised that the ice cream was seriously good and were convinced it
                        should be served in the best restaurants. So we joined our parents at Rainbow Cone's.
